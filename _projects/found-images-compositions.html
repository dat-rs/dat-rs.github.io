<p class="text first-p">
        The Found Images Composition Series is an ever-running experiment of sourcing, laying out and just overall collaging imagery from a variety of sources. An exercise in image (re)making, juxtaposition and the creation of meaning, it is done
        absolutely just for fun and therapeutically and for the learning journey.
</p>
<p class="text">
        It has also allowed me to develop my post-rationalisation skills and the hability to pseudo-intelectually justify the stuff I make just for fun, a helpful thing in a late-capitalism world where the joy of creation isn’t enough to justify your
        time and you feel the need to make sense of the act of creation in a productiveness-oriented paradigm. ☺
</p>
<p class="text">
        Most of the images used in these series were made available online by a number of different entities from across the world under Creative Commons licences. That has allowed me to source and repurpose a myriad of images of different types, ages,
        geographic origins and media, undoubtedly contributing to the visual and conceptual richness and depth of the work. The merit belongs entirely to the original authors of the visual material and to the people and institutions that made it
        available and accessible to everyone — the community.
