    «This opinion piece was assembled using statements from <strong>Republican</strong> senators in 2016 as they were
    trying to prevent President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee from being confirmed. Senators argued the election
    was happening
    too soon (though it was almost eight months away) and that appointing a new justice would prevent Americans from
    having their say.»
